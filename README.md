## Analysis
### Scenario
As a team, we designed the web app DiveXplore Dive Club to offer dive courses, dive trips, and additional service ‚Äúdigital dive log‚Äù.
A new user visits the platform as a guest, browses available dive courses, and books a course without mandatory login. Similarly, guests can explore and book dive trips without needing an account.
To enforce safety protocols, users are prompted to provide valid dive certification when booking restricted trips or courses, ensuring only qualified divers can participate.

Users can optionally create an account to access the digital dive log service, where they securely log dive details (depth, time, location, notes, ....) and upload photos via free-tier cloud storage. Once registered, they can view and/or edit their dive logs by adding, updating, or deleting entries. Additionally, users can delete their accounts.

On the administrative side, admins manage the platform by adding/updating courses, trips, and general content. They adjust trip availability, enforce certification requirements, and maintain user accounts (e.g., deactivating suspicious accounts or resetting passwords). User autonomy is prioritized: divers retain full control over their data, including the ability to delete dive logs permanently.

### User Stories


### Use Cases


## Design
<!-- Repo Owner Notes: 
 Keep in mind the Corporate Identity (CI); you shall decide appropriately the color schema, graphics, typography, layout, User Experience (UX), and so on. -->
### Wireframe Design
<!-- Repo Owner Notes:
It is suggested to start with a wireframe. The wireframe focuses on the website structure (Sitemap planning), sketching the pages using Wireframe components (e.g., header, menu, footer) and UX. You can create a wireframe already with draw.io or similar tools.-->
### Prototype Design
<!-- Repo Owner Notes:
A prototype can be designed using placeholder text/figures in Budibase. You don't need to connect the front-end to back-end in the early stages of the project development.
-->
### Domain Design
<!-- Repo Owner Notes:
Provide a picture and describe your domain model; you may use Entity-Relationship Model or UML class diagram. Both can be created in Visual Paradigm - we have an academic license for it.
The ch.fhnw.pizza.data.domain package contains the following domain objects / entities including getters and setters:

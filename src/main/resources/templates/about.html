        <div class="story-text-content">
          <p>Founded in 2017 by a group of passionate scuba divers, OceanDive began as a small dive shop with a big dream: to share the wonder and beauty of the underwater world with everyone.</p>
          <p>What started as weekend diving trips for friends has grown into a comprehensive diving education and adventure company, serving thousands of divers from around Switzerland. Our commitment to safety, environmental conservation, and exceptional customer service has made us a trusted name in the diving community.</p>
          <p>Today we continue to operate with the same passion and dedication that inspired our founding, always putting our divers' safety and satisfaction first.</p>
